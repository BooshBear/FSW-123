# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Capstone ->
    For this capstone I will create something like a music genre finder.
    The API will be from "https://binaryjazz.us/wp-json/genrenator/v1/genre/"
    The 2 CRUD options I choose were Create and Delete.
    

Submission Instructions ->
    You will submit a screenshot of the rendered output and the GitHub URL to your assignment files, so I can review your code. Then, you will add your assignment to Portfolium and submit the URL

    How to Submit Your GitHub URL :

    When you’re done, stage, commit, and then push your changes to your Github repository. (Note: Make sure these files are located inside this week's directory inside your “FSW-123 Assignments” folder on your local machine. If done correctly, your new folder containing this exercise will now show up in your GitHub repository).
    Then, copy the URL. Your URL should look similar to this: https://github.com/username/class/week/project
    You will submit this GitHub URL to Portfolium below, along with the screenshot.
    How to Take a Screenshot:

    Take a screenshot of the required material, ensuring everything can be seen. You can save your screenshot as an image or paste it to a Word document. 
    Add your assignment to Portfolium and submit the URL:

    Log into  Portfolium  (Links to an external site.) and click + New Project.  For help with this,  watch the video (Links to an external site.)  tutorial  (Links to an external site.) or read the instructions on  how to add a new project to Portfolium.
    If applicable, include your GitHub repository URL and screenshot in your Project (where it says Upload Attachments -> Paste a link).
    Here in Canvas, click Submit Assignment. Upload the URL of the Project you created (example:  https://portfolium.com/en try/testproject-4  (Links to an external site.)). In the Comments, enter your GitHub repository URL
